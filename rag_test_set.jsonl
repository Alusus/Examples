The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content.

When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Math\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nclass Point {\n    def x : Float;\n    def y : Float;\n};\n\nfunc triangleArea(p1: Point, p2: Point, p3: Point): Float {\n    return Math.abs(p1.x*(p2.y-p3.y) + p2.x*(p3.y-p1.y) + p3.x*(p1.y-p2.y)) / 2.0;\n}\n"}]}

The following example shows usage of this dynamic array.\n```\nfunc main {\n  def a: Array[Int] = getArray();\n  a.add(1); // Here the allocated memory block is expanded.\n  def a2: Array[Int] = a; // No new memory block is allocated here.\n  a.add(2); // Now a new copy of the buffer is created so a2 is not affected.\n  printArray(a); // No new memory block is created or copied here.\n  // Now the memory blocks of a and a2 are freed.\n}\n\nfunc getArray(): Array[Int] {\n  def a: Array[Int];\n  a.add(0);\n  return a; // No new memory block is allocated here and memory copy happens.\n}\n\nfunc printArray (a: Array[Int]) {\n  def i: Int;\n  for i = 0, i < a.getLength(), ++i Console.print(\"%d\\n\", a(i));\n}\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n```\n  handler this~init(ref[Array[ContentType]]);\n  handler this~init(count: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe first form initializes an array from another. The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunc selectionSort(a: ref[Array[Int]]) {\n    def i: Int;\n    def j: Int;\n    def temp: Int;\n    def min_idx: Int;\n\n    for i = 0 , i < a.getLength() - 1 , i++ {\n        min_idx = i;\n        for j = i + 1 , j < a.getLength() , j++ {\n            if a(j)  < a(min_idx) {\n                min_idx = j;\n            }\n        }\n\n        temp = a(min_idx);\n        a(min_idx) = a(i);\n        a(i) = temp;\n    }\n}\n"}]}
