For example:\n```\nwhile r!=0 r=performOperation();\nwhile r!=0 { r = performOperation() }\nfor i=0, i<10, i++ print(\"%d\\n\", i);\nfor (i=0, i<10, i++) print(\"%d\\n\", i);\nfor i=0, i<10, i++ { print(\"%d\\n\", i) };\n```\n\nFunctions are defined using `function` as the definition in `def` command.\n```\ndef <func name> : function (<arguments>) => <return_type> { <function_body> }\n```\nArguments take the following form:\n```\n<arg_name>:<arg_type>, <arg_name>:<arg_type> ...\n```\nFor example:\n```\ndef factorial : function (i:Int) => Int\n{\n    if i==1 return 1;\n    return i*factorial(i-1);\n}\n```\nIt is also possible to use a short form without the `def` command, as follows:\n```\nfunction <func name> (<arguments>) => <return_type> { <function_body> }\n```\nFor example:\n```\nfunction factorial (i:Int) => Int\n{\n    if i==1 return 1;\n    return i*factorial(i-1);\n}\n```\nCalling a function is done by using the function's name followed by the arguments list enclosed in round brackets. In case of no arguments, the function name is followed by empty round brackets.\n```\nx = readNumber();\ny = readNumber();\ndrawPoint(x, y);\n```\n\nA dynamic array template that automatically manages the array buffer, taking performance into account and avoiding unnecessary memory allocation and copying operations. The following example shows usage of this dynamic array.\n```\nfunc main {\n  def a: Array[Int] = getArray();\n  a.add(1); // Here the allocated memory block is expanded.\n  def a2: Array[Int] = a; // No new memory block is allocated here.\n  a.add(2); // Now a new copy of the buffer is created so a2 is not affected.\n  printArray(a); // No new memory block is created or copied here.\n  // Now the memory blocks of a and a2 are freed.\n}\n\nfunc getArray(): Array[Int] {\n  def a: Array[Int];\n  a.add(0);\n  return a; // No new memory block is allocated here and memory copy happens.\n}\n\nfunc printArray (a: Array[Int]) {\n  def i: Int;\n  for i = 0, i < a.getLength(), ++i Console.print(\"%d\\n\", a(i));\n}\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n```\n  handler this~init(ref[Array[ContentType]]);\n  handler this~init(count: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe first form initializes an array from another. The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\nimport \"Srl/Map\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nfunc unique(a: ref[Array[Int]]): Array[Int] {\n    def hash: Map[Int, Bool];\n    def result: Array[Int];\n\n    def i: Int;\n    for i = 0 , i < a.getLength() , i++ {\n        if hash.findPos(a(i)) == -1 {\n            result.add(a(i));\n            hash.set(a(i), true);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n"}]}

When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\n\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\ndef MAX: Int = 100000;\n\n\nfunc findFrequency(a: ref[Array[Int]], freq: ref[Array[Int]]) {\n    def i: Int;\n    for i = 0 , i < MAX , i++ {\n        freq.add(0);\n    }\n\n    for i = 0 , i < a.getLength() , i++ {\n        freq(a(i))++;\n    }\n}\n"}]}

The following example shows usage of this dynamic array.\n```\nfunc main {\n  def a: Array[Int] = getArray();\n  a.add(1); // Here the allocated memory block is expanded.\n  def a2: Array[Int] = a; // No new memory block is allocated here.\n  a.add(2); // Now a new copy of the buffer is created so a2 is not affected.\n  printArray(a); // No new memory block is created or copied here.\n  // Now the memory blocks of a and a2 are freed.\n}\n\nfunc getArray(): Array[Int] {\n  def a: Array[Int];\n  a.add(0);\n  return a; // No new memory block is allocated here and memory copy happens.\n}\n\nfunc printArray (a: Array[Int]) {\n  def i: Int;\n  for i = 0, i < a.getLength(), ++i Console.print(\"%d\\n\", a(i));\n}\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n```\n  handler this~init(ref[Array[ContentType]]);\n  handler this~init(count: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe first form initializes an array from another. The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunc merge(a: ref[Array[Int]], l: Int, m: Int, r: Int) {\n    def i: Int;\n    def j: Int;\n    def k: Int;\n\n    def n1: Int = m - l + 1;\n    def n2: Int = r - m;\n\n    def L: Array[Int];\n    def R: Array[Int];\n\n    for i = 0 , i < n1 , i++ {\n        L.add(a(l+i));\n    }\n    for i = 0 , i < n2 , i++ {\n        R.add(a(m + 1 + i));\n    }\n\n    i = 0;\n    j = 0;\n    k = l;\n    while i < n1 && j < n2 {\n        if L(i) <= R(j) {\n            a(k) = L(i);\n            i++;\n        }\n        else {\n            a(k) = R(j);\n            j++;\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    while i < n1 {\n        a(k) = L(i);\n        i++;\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    while j < n2 {\n        a(k) = R(j);\n        j++;\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n\nfunc mergeSort(a: ref[Array[Int]], l: Int, r: Int) {\n     if l < r {\n        def m: Int = l + (r - l) / 2;\n\n        mergeSort(a, l, m);\n        mergeSort(a, m + 1, r);\n\n        merge(a, l, m, r);\n     }\n}\n"}]}

For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Fs\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\nimport \"Srl/Array\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunc readFileToArray(file_path: ref[String]): Array[String] {\n    def file: ptr[Fs.File] = Fs.openFile(file_path.buf, \"r\");\n    def content: Array[String];\n\n    Fs.seek(file, 0, Fs.Seek.END);\n    def size: Int = Fs.tell(file);\n    Fs.seek(file, 0, Fs.Seek.SET);\n    \n    content.add(String());\n    def i: Int;\n    def j: Int = 0;\n    for i = 0 , i < size , i++ {\n        def temp: Char;\n        Fs.read(temp~ptr, 1, 1, file);\n\n        if temp == '\\n' {\n            content.add(String());\n            j++;\n        }\n        else {\n            content(j).append(temp);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return content;\n}\n"}]}

Variable's type specified inside Square brackets as follows:\n```\nptr[the_type]\n```\n\nPointers are used to point to locations in memory and control the contents of those locations. They are defined by using the `ptr` built-in type, followed by the content type between square brackets.\n```\ndef <ptr_name> : ptr[<content_type>]\n```\nIt is possible to access the content pointed to by a pointer with the `~cnt` operator. Also, it is possible to get the location of any variable using `~ptr` operator, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  def p : ptr[Int];\n  def x : Int;\n  x = 5;\n  p = x~ptr;\n  p~cnt = 1;\n  // x is now equal to 1, not 5.\n```\nAddition and subtraction operations are allowed on pointers. In that case the amount of increase in pointer's value will be a multiple of class size that the pointer points to.

This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically.

For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find.

This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from.

Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunction invertString(s) {\n    def size: Int = s.getLength();\n    def result: String = \"\";\n\n    def i: Int;\n    for i = size - 1 , i >= 0 , i-- {\n        result += s(i);\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n"}]}

The following example shows usage of this dynamic array.\n```\nfunc main {\n  def a: Array[Int] = getArray();\n  a.add(1); // Here the allocated memory block is expanded.\n  def a2: Array[Int] = a; // No new memory block is allocated here.\n  a.add(2); // Now a new copy of the buffer is created so a2 is not affected.\n  printArray(a); // No new memory block is created or copied here.\n  // Now the memory blocks of a and a2 are freed.\n}\n\nfunc getArray(): Array[Int] {\n  def a: Array[Int];\n  a.add(0);\n  return a; // No new memory block is allocated here and memory copy happens.\n}\n\nfunc printArray (a: Array[Int]) {\n  def i: Int;\n  for i = 0, i < a.getLength(), ++i Console.print(\"%d\\n\", a(i));\n}\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n```\n  handler this~init(ref[Array[ContentType]]);\n  handler this~init(count: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe first form initializes an array from another. The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nfunc dfs(node: Int, visited: ref[Array[Bool]], graph: ref[Array[Array[Int]]]) {\n    visited(node) = true;\n    Console.print(\"%d \", node);\n\n    def i: Int;\n    for i = 0 , i < graph(node).getLength(), i++ {\n        def childNode: Int = graph(node)(i);\n        if !visited(childNode) {\n            dfs(childNode, visited, graph);\n        }\n    }\n}\n"}]}

Variable's type specified inside Square brackets as follows:\n```\nptr[the_type]\n```\n\nPointers are used to point to locations in memory and control the contents of those locations. They are defined by using the `ptr` built-in type, followed by the content type between square brackets.\n```\ndef <ptr_name> : ptr[<content_type>]\n```\nIt is possible to access the content pointed to by a pointer with the `~cnt` operator. Also, it is possible to get the location of any variable using `~ptr` operator, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  def p : ptr[Int];\n  def x : Int;\n  x = 5;\n  p = x~ptr;\n  p~cnt = 1;\n  // x is now equal to 1, not 5.\n```\nAddition and subtraction operations are allowed on pointers. In that case the amount of increase in pointer's value will be a multiple of class size that the pointer points to.

For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/String\";\n\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunc starts_with(s: ref[String], prefix: ref[String]): Bool {\n\tif s.getLength() < prefix.getLength() {\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\n    def i: Int;\n\tfor i = 0 , i < prefix.getLength() , i++ {\n\t\tif (prefix(i) != s(i)) {\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn true;\n}\n"}]}

In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\n\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunc find_diff_index(a1: ref[Array[Int]], a2: ref[Array[Int]]): Int {\n    def i: Int;\n    for i = 0 , i < a1.getLength() , i++ {\n        if a1(i) != a2(i) {\n            return i;\n        }\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n"}]}

For example:\n```\nwhile r!=0 r=performOperation();\nwhile r!=0 { r = performOperation() }\nfor i=0, i<10, i++ print(\"%d\\n\", i);\nfor (i=0, i<10, i++) print(\"%d\\n\", i);\nfor i=0, i<10, i++ { print(\"%d\\n\", i) };\n```\n\nFunctions are defined using `function` as the definition in `def` command.\n```\ndef <func name> : function (<arguments>) => <return_type> { <function_body> }\n```\nArguments take the following form:\n```\n<arg_name>:<arg_type>, <arg_name>:<arg_type> ...\n```\nFor example:\n```\ndef factorial : function (i:Int) => Int\n{\n    if i==1 return 1;\n    return i*factorial(i-1);\n}\n```\nIt is also possible to use a short form without the `def` command, as follows:\n```\nfunction <func name> (<arguments>) => <return_type> { <function_body> }\n```\nFor example:\n```\nfunction factorial (i:Int) => Int\n{\n    if i==1 return 1;\n    return i*factorial(i-1);\n}\n```\nCalling a function is done by using the function's name followed by the arguments list enclosed in round brackets. In case of no arguments, the function name is followed by empty round brackets.\n```\nx = readNumber();\ny = readNumber();\ndrawPoint(x, y);\n```\n\nReferences are similar to how pointers work, except that it is simpler to deal with because it requires only defining the variable as reference, then dealing with it in the same way as we deal with the regular variables, which means it is possible to access the content without the need to use `cnt` operator.\n```\ndef <ref_name> : ref[<content_type>]\n```\nBefore using the reference we need to specify the pointer's value for that reference, which vary depending on whether the reference is an argument for some function or not. If the reference is a function's argument then all we need is passing a variable with the same type of the reference's content of that function, and the compiler will automatically pass a pointer to that variable and use it for that reference, as shown in the next example.\n```\n  func twice (ri: ref[int]) { ri *= 2 };\n\n  def i: int = 5;\n  twice(i);\n  // now i == 10\n```\nIn the case of the reference being defined as a regular variable and not an argument to a function, we need to specify its pointer manually as shown in the next example:\n```\n  def ri: ref[Int];\n  def i: Int;\n  ri~ptr = i~ptr;\n  ri = 3;\n  // now i == 3\n```\nIt is also possible to use `~ptr` operator to make the reference point to a dynamically allocated memory.\n```\n  def r: ref[MyType];\n  r~ptr = Memory.alloc(MyType~size)~cast[ptr[MyType]];\n```\nIt is also possible to define a reference to a reference as shown in the next example:\n```\n  def rri: ref[ref[Int]];\n  def ri: ref[Int];\n  def i: Int;\n  ri~ptr = i~ptr;\n  rri~ptr~ptr = ri~ptr~ptr;\n  rri = 3;\n  // now i == 3\n```\nNote that `~ptr` operator starts always with the content. In other words, if we define x as `ref[ref[Int]]` and y as `ref[Int]` then `x~ptr` and `y~ptr` both return a pointer to `Int`. Also, operations on references are always applied on the content regardless of reference depth, therefore `x = 5` and `y = 5` both modify the content despite the fact that `x` is a double reference.\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program.

Variable's type specified inside Square brackets as follows:\n```\nptr[the_type]\n```\n\nPointers are used to point to locations in memory and control the contents of those locations. They are defined by using the `ptr` built-in type, followed by the content type between square brackets.\n```\ndef <ptr_name> : ptr[<content_type>]\n```\nIt is possible to access the content pointed to by a pointer with the `~cnt` operator. Also, it is possible to get the location of any variable using `~ptr` operator, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  def p : ptr[Int];\n  def x : Int;\n  x = 5;\n  p = x~ptr;\n  p~cnt = 1;\n  // x is now equal to 1, not 5.\n```\nAddition and subtraction operations are allowed on pointers. In that case the amount of increase in pointer's value will be a multiple of class size that the pointer points to.

The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content.

If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array.

Variable's type specified inside Square brackets as follows:\n```\nptr[the_type]\n```\n\nPointers are used to point to locations in memory and control the contents of those locations. They are defined by using the `ptr` built-in type, followed by the content type between square brackets.\n```\ndef <ptr_name> : ptr[<content_type>]\n```\nIt is possible to access the content pointed to by a pointer with the `~cnt` operator. Also, it is possible to get the location of any variable using `~ptr` operator, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  def p : ptr[Int];\n  def x : Int;\n  x = 5;\n  p = x~ptr;\n  p~cnt = 1;\n  // x is now equal to 1, not 5.\n```\nAddition and subtraction operations are allowed on pointers. In that case the amount of increase in pointer's value will be a multiple of class size that the pointer points to. For example, if we add 1 to a pointer to `Int`, the value of the pointer will increase by `Int` size, which means 4 bytes when `Int` is represented using 32bit.\n```\n  def p1: ptr[Int[32]] = ...;\n  def p2: ptr[Char] = ...;\n  p1 = p1 + 1; // Incremented by 4.\n  p1 = p1 + 5; // Incremented by 5 * 4.\n  p2 = p2 + 1; // Incremented by 1.\n  p2 = p2 + 5; // Incremented by 5.\n```\n\nFunctions are defined using `function` as the definition in `def` command.\n```\ndef <func name> : function (<arguments>) => <return_type> { <function_body> }\n```\nArguments take the following form:\n```\n<arg_name>:<arg_type>, <arg_name>:<arg_type> ...\n```\nFor example:\n```\ndef factorial : function (i:Int) => Int\n{\n    if i==1 return 1;\n    return i*factorial(i-1);\n}\n```\nIt is also possible to use a short form without the `def` command, as follows:\n```\nfunction <func name> (<arguments>) => <return_type> { <function_body> }\n```\nFor example:\n```\nfunction factorial (i:Int) => Int\n{\n    if i==1 return 1;\n    return i*factorial(i-1);\n}\n```\nCalling a function is done by using the function's name followed by the arguments list enclosed in round brackets.

The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array.

The following example shows usage of this dynamic array.\n```\nfunc main {\n  def a: Array[Int] = getArray();\n  a.add(1); // Here the allocated memory block is expanded.\n  def a2: Array[Int] = a; // No new memory block is allocated here.\n  a.add(2); // Now a new copy of the buffer is created so a2 is not affected.\n  printArray(a); // No new memory block is created or copied here.\n  // Now the memory blocks of a and a2 are freed.\n}\n\nfunc getArray(): Array[Int] {\n  def a: Array[Int];\n  a.add(0);\n  return a; // No new memory block is allocated here and memory copy happens.\n}\n\nfunc printArray (a: Array[Int]) {\n  def i: Int;\n  for i = 0, i < a.getLength(), ++i Console.print(\"%d\\n\", a(i));\n}\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n```\n  handler this~init(ref[Array[ContentType]]);\n  handler this~init(count: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe first form initializes an array from another. The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nfunc floydWarshall(graph: ref[Array[Array[Int]]], dist: ref[Array[Array[Int]]]) {\n    def n: Int = graph.getLength();\n    def i: Int;\n    def j: Int;\n    def k: Int;\n\n    for i = 0 , i < n , i++ {\n        dist.add(graph(i));\n    }\n\n    for k = 0 , k < n , k++ {\n        for i = 0 , i < n , i++ {\n            for j = 0 , j < n , j++ {\n                if dist(i)(k) + dist(k)(j) < dist(i)(j) {\n                    dist(i)(j) = dist(i)(k) + dist(k)(j);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n"}]}

The following example shows usage of this dynamic array.\n```\nfunc main {\n  def a: Array[Int] = getArray();\n  a.add(1); // Here the allocated memory block is expanded.\n  def a2: Array[Int] = a; // No new memory block is allocated here.\n  a.add(2); // Now a new copy of the buffer is created so a2 is not affected.\n  printArray(a); // No new memory block is created or copied here.\n  // Now the memory blocks of a and a2 are freed.\n}\n\nfunc getArray(): Array[Int] {\n  def a: Array[Int];\n  a.add(0);\n  return a; // No new memory block is allocated here and memory copy happens.\n}\n\nfunc printArray (a: Array[Int]) {\n  def i: Int;\n  for i = 0, i < a.getLength(), ++i Console.print(\"%d\\n\", a(i));\n}\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n```\n  handler this~init(ref[Array[ContentType]]);\n  handler this~init(count: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe first form initializes an array from another. The new array will use the same content of the given array, and no copy will happen until one of them changes the content. In that case, the content is copied before the change occurs to ensure that the other array is not affected.\nThe second form initializes the array from the given items, as shown in the example below:\n```\ndef a1: Array[Int]({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\ndef a2: Array[Int](3, 5, 2, 1); // Array will contain 3 elements: 5, 2, and 1.\n```\n\nThere are 3 versions of this method:\nThe first form adds an item to the array after extending the allocated memory if necessary. If the content is shared with another array, this function copies the content to a new buffer.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: ContentType);\n```\nThe second form adds many items at once.\n```\nhandler this.add (argCount: Int, args: ...ContentType);\n```\nThe third form adds an array to the current array. It adds all items of the given array to the current array. The given array will not be affected by this call.\n```\nhandler this.add (e: Array[ContentType]);\n```\nExample:\n```\na.add({ 5, 2, 1 }); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\na.add(3, 5, 2, 1); // Adds 3 elements: 5, 2, 1.\n```\n\n`import` command is used to load a source code or a library and use it in the program. This command automatically distinguished between a source code and a library. Currently, this command supports three types of files: source codes, general dynamic libraries, and build libraries like libalusus_spp. It is possible to load any dynamic library regardless of the language it was built from. When loading a dynamic library all its public functions become available to use inside Alusus program, but you need to define those function manually using the `function` command with `@expname` modifier, as shown in the next example:\n```\n  import \"libmath.so\";\n  def sin: @expname[sin] function (f: Float) => Float;\n\n  s = sin(r);\n```\nIt is possible to discard the extension in `import` statement, the Core will add it automatically. For example it is possible to shorten the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String.alusus\";\n```\ninto the following:\n```\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n```\nIt is also possible to discard the extension and a prefix in dynamic library names. For example, the following:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\";\n```\ncan be shortened into:\n```\nimport \"math\";\n```\nIn the previous case, the core will try to load the file \"math.alusus\", if not found, it will try to load \"libmath.so\" on Linux, or \"libmath.dylib\" on mac.\nIn some cases, you may need to give multiple file names choices for the Core to choose from, and it will load the first one it can find. Providing multiple choices is useful to support multiple operating systems with the same source code. This is done using `or` inside `import` statement, as shown in the following example:\n```\nimport \"libmath.so\" or \"libmath.so.0\";\n```\nIt is also possible to use `||` instead of `or` in the previous example.\n\nTo print something in enAlusus it is possible to use `print` function from `Console` module which is similar to `printf` in c.\nfor example:\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\nConsole.print(\"hello world!\");\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n\n```\nimport \"Srl/Console\";\nimport \"Srl/String\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\ndef s: String = \"hi there!\";\nConsole.print(\"%s\", s.buf);\n```\n,\n        answer:\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import \"Srl/Array\";\n\nuse Srl;\n\n\nfunc insertionSort(a: ref[Array[Int]]) {\n    def i: Int;\n    def key: Int;\n    def j: Int;\n\n    for i = 1 , i < a.getLength() , i++ {\n        key = a(i);\n        j = i - 1;\n\n        while j >= 0 && a(j) > key {\n            a(j + 1) = a(j);\n            j = j - 1;\n        }\n        a(j + 1) = key;\n    }\n}\n"}]}
