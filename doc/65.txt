Create a new string from given format after filling it with the given arguments. This function is similar to `sprintf` function, by replacing symbols starting with `%` in the format by a value from arguments that match the type specified. The symbol `%` is followed by a character specifying the type of the given argument. As follows:
%s Array of chars.
%c A single char.
%i 32 bits integer
%l 64 bits integer
%f 32 bits float
%d 64 bits float
%% Prints the `%` symbol
```
func format (fmt: ptr[array[Char]], values: ...any): String;
```
