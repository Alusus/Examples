Round brackets are used in places evaluated at runtime, such as summing items in a container or passing arguments to functions. On the other hand, square brackets are used in places evaluated at compile time, such as specifying pointer or array types. In other words, if the information specified by the brackets will be evaluated at compile time, we use square brackets; otherwise, we use round brackets.
