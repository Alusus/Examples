Arrays are defined using the `array` built-in type, followed by the elements' type and count between square brackets.
```
def <array_name> : array[<element_type>, <element_count>]
```
It is possible to access an element in the array by putting its index inside square brackets, as follows:
```
  def myArray : array[Int, 10];
  def i : Int;
  for i=0, i<10, i++ {
    myArray(i) = factorial(i)
  }
```
