Classes are defined using `class` command as the definition in `def` command.
```
def <type_name> : class { <definition_statements> }
```
Accessing class members is done using `.` operator, for example:
```
def Point : class {
    def x : Float;
    def y : Float
};

def p : Point;
p.x = 1;
p.y = 2;
```
It is possible to use the short form without `def` as follows:
```
class <type_name> { <definition_statements> }
```
As show in the next example:
```
class Point {
    def x : Float;
    def y : Float
};

def p : Point;
p.x = 1;
p.y = 2;
```
